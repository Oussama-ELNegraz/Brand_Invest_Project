# Brand Influencer

## Description
This project aims to create a platform that connects influencers and brands for possible partnerships. The platform allows new influencers and brands to sign up by providing their respective identities and other relevant information. Once authenticated, influencers can contact any brand, and vice versa, for potential partnership discussions.
